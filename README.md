# Design Process
- My original designs were more cluttered, with too many things happening. This design was intended to be clean and simple.
- Although I wanted something clean and simple, I also wanted the feeling to be 'soft', which I tried to address in the color palette and fonts
- The overall design was inspired by the beach - because the sky and the sea represent endlessness and change to me. I felt that this resonates with the fast-changing nature and limitless potential of technology.

- Fonts:
    - I wanted cursive for the hero and headings to evoke a sense of creativity
        - Hero: Zeyada
        - Headings: Yesteryear
    - I chose a typewriter font because I felt that it would work well with the color palette and paper-like themes
        - Content: Zilla Slab
- Colorscheme: 
    - The colorscheme was inspired by the beach.
    - I originally wanted to include a large amount of blue, but found that I couldn't create enough contrast to direct attention
    - I ended up using lots of sandy-brown colours, with splashes of blue, and some near-black and off-white as neutral colours
    - #FFFAFA (off-white)
    - #D1CDC6 (sandy brown)
    - #5E5645 (dark brown)
    - #95C5D8 (light blue)
    - #3D3D3D (near black)

# Development Process
## What Went Well
- The contrast is much better than previous designs
- Creating and formatting a general .content class, and putting that class in each section made organising tags fast and easy
- Scaling from mobile to desktop had few problems
- The nav-bar took some time to create, but ended up working very reliably (without interfering with other elements)
- I couldn't manage to make icons work, but I still managed to have a glow effect on the contact links by making them square, and adding a box-shadow on hover
- The contact form at the bottom looks clean and natural to me
- The folder in the Technologies section doesn't scale nicely on desktop, but I'm happy with the animation
- Creating the cards in the History section was easier than I expected, and has no issues on scaling (that I know of)

## What Was Challenging 
- I struggled with the bio information - keeping it brief and concise
- The design process was especially challenging. I had problems with:
    - colour contrast
    - keeping a minimalist design on a mobile screen
    - Picking fonts that were 'creative' but not too unprofessional
- The hardest part was the folder design 
    - The animation was easier than anicipated, and the z-index was not as challenging, but scaling from mobile to desktop was challenging, and it still doesn't work perfectly

## What Got Changed
- The header image
    - It didn't scale well from mobile to desktop
- The nav buttons
    - The original effect was supposed to have the button split into three, with the first and last separating from the center
    - After thinking about it, I realised it would take too much time, and may confuse the user
- I ended up adding a picture of myself at the beach
    - The design was not based on this picture, but it fits the colour palette well
    - I included it because without it, the design had more of a 'bland office' vibe. I feel that the picture ensures that the site is recieved as having a beach theme.
- The files in the technologies folder were originally going to come out completely
    - This had problems, as the hover effect ends unless the user follows the file up with their mouse (which they wouldn't...) 
        - This leads to a jarring effect where the file would vibrate between the :link and :hover state
- I had to make the contact icons square shaped, so that I could illuminate them with the box-shadow effect on hover

## Where To From Here?
- I still want to get the scaling on the technologies folder to work nicely on desktop
- I want to have a photoboard instead of just the one photo (but I don't have any photos...)
